## 📖 Overview

**Security Toolkit** is an all-in-one cryptographic suite designed for educational purposes and practical use. It enables users to visualize and execute complex algorithms involved in encryption, decryption, hashing, and key exchange. The application features a clean, tabbed interface with a "Hacker/Cyberpunk" aesthetic (Dark Blue/Green) for an immersive experience.

## ✨ Features

### 🔑 Public Key Cryptography
*   **RSA Encryption System**:
    *   Automated Prime & Key Generation (Public/Private keys).
    *   Encrypt and Decrypt text messages.
    *   Support for file input and output.
*   **Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange**:
    *   Simulate secure key exchange between two parties (Alice & Bob).
    *   Visualize the generation of public keys and the shared secret.
*   **DSS (Digital Signature Standard)**:
    *   Algorithm parameter visualization (p, q, g).
    *   Sign messages to create digital signatures.
    *   Verify signatures to ensure authenticity.

### 🔒 Symmetric Key Cryptography
*   **DES (Data Encryption Standard)**:
    *   **Key Generator**: Visualizes the generation of 16 round keys from a 64-bit hexadecimal master key.
    *   Detailed breakdown of shifts and permutations (PC-1, PC-2).
*   **S-DES (Simplified DES)**:
    *   Educational 8-bit block cipher implementation.
    *   10-bit Key input with automatic subkey generation (K1, K2).
    *   Full encryption and decryption pipeline.

### 🛡️ Hashing Algorithms
*   **MD5 (Message Digest Algorithm 5)**:
    *   **Round 1 Visualizer**: Step-by-step log of the first 16 operations of the MD5 first round.
    *   **Full MD5**: Calculate 128-bit hash digests for any text or file.
*   **SHA-1 (Secure Hash Algorithm 1)**:
    *   Generate standard 160-bit hash digests.
    *   Secure and fast implementation.

### ⚙️ Utility Features
*   **File Operations**: Load text files (`.txt`) directly into input fields and save results to files.
*   **Clipboard Integration**: One-click buttons to copy results.
*   **Responsive GUI**: Modern, dark-themed interface built with `ttk` styling.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

*   **Python 3.6+**: Ensure Python is installed on your system.
    *   [Download Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

#### 🖥️ How to Verify if Tkinter is Installed

Run this command in your terminal to check if Tkinter is ready:
```bash
python -m tkinter
```
*   **Success**: A small window titled "Tk Interface" appears.
*   **Failure**: You see an error like `No module named tkinter`.

#### 🛠️ How to Install Tkinter

**For Windows Users:**
If the verification failed, Tkinter wasn't selected during Python installation. Here is how to fix it:
1.  Go to **Windows Settings** -> **Apps** -> **Installed Apps**.
2.  Find your **Python** version (e.g., "Python 3.x.x").
3.  Click the "..." menu or "Modify" button.
4.  Select **Modify**.
5.  On the "Optional Features" screen, ensure **"tcl/tk and IDLE"** is CHECKED.
6.  Click **Next** and then **Install** to update your Python version.

**For Linux Users:**
*   **Ubuntu / Debian**:
    ```bash
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install python3-tk
    ```
*   **Fedora**:
    ```bash
    sudo dnf install python3-tkinter
    ```
*   **macOS**: Installed by default. If missing, reinstall Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository** (or download the source code):
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Mahmoud-keno/security-toolkit.git
    cd security-toolkit
    ```

2.  **No external dependencies required**: The project uses only standard Python libraries (`tkinter`, `random`, `struct`, `math`).

### 🏃 How to Run

1.  Open your terminal or command prompt.
2.  Navigate to the project directory.
3.  Run the application using Python:

    ```bash
    python security_toolkit.py
    ```

4.  The GUI window should appear immediately.

## 🖥️ Usage Guide

1.  **Navigation**: Use the tabs at the top (RSA, DES, S-DES, etc.) to switch between algorithms.
2.  **Input**:
    *   **Text**: Type directly into the input fields.
    *   **Files**: Click the **📂 Load File** button to read text from a local `.txt` file.
3.  **Action**: Click the main action buttons (e.g., **Key Generation**, **Encrypt**, **Run Round 1**) to execute the algorithm.
4.  **Output**:
    *   Results are shown in the output text areas or logs.
    *   **Copy**: Click the **📋** button to copy to clipboard.
    *   **Save**: Click the **💾** button to save the result to a text file.
