## 📖 Overview

**Security Toolkit** is an all-in-one cryptographic suite designed for both **practical use** ("Codes") and **education** ("Explanation").

Upon launching, users are greeted with a **Landing Page** to choose their mode:
1.  **🛠️ Codes**: Visualize and execute complexity algorithms (Encryption, Decryption, Hashing).
2.  **📚 Explanation**: Learn the concepts behind these algorithms with detailed text summaries and **schematic diagrams**.

The application features a clean, "hacker/cyberpunk" aesthetic (Dark Blue/Neon Green) and a highly responsive, compact interface.

## ✨ Features

### 📚 Explanation Mode (NEW!)
*   **Visual Learning**: High-quality schematic diagrams for every algorithm (RSA, DES, S-DES, MD5, SHA-1, DSS, Diffie-Hellman).
*   **Split View Layout**: Explanations on the left, diagrams on the right for easy reading.
*   **Comprehensive Summaries**: Detailed text breaking down the history and mechanics of each method.

### 🔑 Public Key Cryptography
*   **RSA Encryption System**:
    *   Automated Prime & Key Generation (Public/Private keys).
    *   Encrypt and Decrypt text messages.
*   **Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange**:
    *   Simulate secure key exchange between two parties (Alice & Bob).
    *   Visual diagram of the exchange process.
*   **DSS (Digital Signature Standard)**:
    *   Algorithm parameter visualization (p, q, g).
    *   Sign and Verify messages to ensure authenticity.

### 🔒 Symmetric Key Cryptography
*   **DES (Data Encryption Standard)**:
    *   **Key Generator**: Visualizes generation of 16 round keys from 64-bit hex key.
    *   Attributes with **visual icons** (📂, 🔑) for better UX.
*   **S-DES (Simplified DES)**:
    *   Educational 8-bit block cipher.
    *   **Optimized Layout**: Logical flow with Key Generation side-by-side with Subkeys.
    *   Full encryption/decryption pipeline.

### 🛡️ Hashing Algorithms
*   **MD5 & Full MD5**: Step-by-step round visualization and full 128-bit digest calculation.
*   **SHA-1 & SHA Family**: Generate standard 160-bit hash digests.

### ⚙️ Utility Features
*   **File Operations**: Load `.txt` files directly into inputs and save results to disk.
*   **Clipboard**: One-click copy buttons (📋).
*   **Compact UI**: "Minimized" padding for a sleek, information-dense display.
