A JSON Web Token (JWT) is a secure way to send information between a client and a server. It is mainly used in web applications and APIs to verify users and prevent unauthorized access. A JWT is JSON data secured with a cryptographic signature.

The signing can be done using these cryptographic methods:

HMAC (Hash-based Message Authentication Code)
RSA or ECDSA (Asymmetric cryptographic algorithms)
JWT Structure
Here is the structure of a JWT:

Structure of a JWT
A JWT consists of three parts, separated by dots (.)

Header. Payload. Signature
Header: Contains metadata about the token, such as the algorithm used for signing.
Payload: Stores the claims, i.e., data being transmitted.
Signature: Ensures the token's integrity and authenticity.
1. Header
The header contains metadata about the token, including the signing algorithm and token type here metadata means data about data.

{
    "alg": "HS256",
    "typ": "JWT"
}
alg: Algorithm used for signing (e.g., HS256, RS256).
typ: Token type, always "JWT".

2. Payload
The payload contains the information about the user also called as a claim and some additional information including the timestamp at which it was issued and the expiry time of the token.

{
    "userId": 123,
    "role": "admin",
    "exp": 1672531199
}
Common claim types:

iss (Issuer): Identifies who issued the token.
sub (Subject): Represents the user or entity the token is about.
aud (Audience): Specifies the intended recipient.
exp (Expiration): Defines when the token expires.
iat (Issued At): Timestamp when the token was created.
nbf (Not Before): Specifies when the token becomes valid.

3. Signature
The signature ensures token integrity and is generated using the header, payload, and a secret key. In this example we will use HS256 algorithm to implement the Signature part

HMACSHA256(
    base64UrlEncode(header) + "." + base64UrlEncode(payload),
    secret
)
Example Signature:

4. Final JWT token
After all these steps the final JWT token is generated by joining the Header, Payload and Signature via a dot. It looks like as it is shown below.
